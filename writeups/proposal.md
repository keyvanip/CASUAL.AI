## Title: P&H Fashion Hub

## Abstract

### Problem Statement

Choosing daily outfits can be daunting and often frustrating. Often times, you try on multiple outfits before heading out, only to find your room scattered with clothes. This is where P&H Fashion Hub comes into play.

At P&H Fashion Hub, we harness the power of Generative AI to create realistic visualizations of models wearing your own wardrobe. This allows you to see different outfit combinations before trying anything on. Even better, our AI provides personalized suggestions based on the occasion, time of day, and weather—making outfit selection effortless and stress-free.

### Approach

We propose an AI-based virtual try-on assistant that allows users to upload images of their wardrobe, specifically tops and bottoms, and generates realistic visualizations of possible outfit combinations. 


### Key Techniques Used

The system uses Generative AI for outfit visualization, RAG for intelligent outfit recommendations based on past preferences and weather conditions, and AI agents to provide personalized styling guidance.

### Main Findings

This AI-powered fashion assistant improves the outfit selection process by reducing the time spent on trial-and-error and enhancing wardrobe usage. We expect to achieve improved decision-making and increased satisfaction with people’s daily outfit choices.
